Hi Mr. B....

I did not recall if I had earlier given you some of the files contained on
this disk.  In any event, I include all the files here you need to run
Turbo-Pascal, including graphics.  I also include some note files (i.e.,
those without any extension) and some codes I've generated in the past
which you might find useful or instructive.  Also, of course, I've included
FAMILY.PAS, the code you asked for.

Since each of the notes files and Pascal codes are in ASCII (i.e., they can
be read in alpha-numeric format) you can easily type out any of them and
see how they are constructed.

You should find the file, COMMANDS, useful as it summarizes all the
commands that you'll find in the book

To run any of the pascal codes, you only need to enter TURBO from the
command line and follow the prompts.  After you enter "y" for the error
messages, you only need to enter "w" to call up a Work file and you'll be
asked for the Work file name.  Simple type in the pascal code you want to
run (e.g., FAMILY) without the extension and the progam will load
FAMILY.PAS.  Then, at the cursor (e.g. >) enter "e" which is for edit and
you will see the contents of the code.  When you are done examining the
code, you can hit the F1 function key to bring back the cursor.  Then to
run the code, simply enter "r" (for run) at the cursor and the program will
run the code.

That's about all there is to it.  If you have any questions, let me know.
Grandmom and I send our love to you and your family.

                               Grandad
